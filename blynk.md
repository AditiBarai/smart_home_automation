# ðŸ’« Blynk :
- Blynk is an IOT platform for iOS or Android smartphones that is used to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and 
NodeMCU via the Internet. This application is used to create a graphical interface or human machine interface (HMI) by 
compiling and providing the appropriate address on the available widgets. 
Blynk was designed for the Internet of Things. It can control hardware remotely, it can display sensor data, it can 
store data, visualize it and do many other cool things.

## Steps :
- Step â€“ 1: Go to blynk.io, then create an account.
- Step â€“ 2: Create a new device, set the widgets as per requirements for both web and android. 
- Step â€“ 3: After proper settings, an api will be generated, which can be found in your device.
- Step â€“ 4: Copy the api key and paste it in the code.
- Step â€“ 5: Now if we run the code, the updated data from the sensor will be uploaded again and again in the blynk cloud and displayed over the web dashboard and android dashboard.
## How to use :
- First connect the pins of sensor accordingly with jumper wire with the ESP-32.
- Then placed it to the top to the container to measure the whole length of the container. 
- Then power on the ESP-32 and run proper code to generate sound wave from TRIGGER of the sensor. 
- Then the wave hits the floor of container/goods keep in container and reverse back to ECHO. 
- Now calculating the distance travelled by the wave to measure how much the container empty and done.
